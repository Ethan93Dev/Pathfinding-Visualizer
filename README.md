The application uses different search algorithms to search and visualise the shortest path. These algorithms operate on a 2d array which is represented in this application as a Grid. The Grid, and animations are all done using the Canvas API.

The folowing are the algorithms visualized in this application:

1. Depth First Search.
2. Breadth First Search.
3. Dijkstra.
4. Astar.
